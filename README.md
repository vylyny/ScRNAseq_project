# ScRNAseq_project

I worked on this scRNAseq project as part of my 'Applying Sequencing Informatics' class. 
The goals of this project were to:
1. Characterize cell subtypes in the Superior Cervical Ganglia (SCG)
2. Investigate how LY294002 and Mirin preferentially modulate transcriptomic profiles, biological pathways or cell abundance at a single cell resolution => novel treatment target for PI3K/MRN associated disorders (Increased specificity; decreased off-target toxicities)
